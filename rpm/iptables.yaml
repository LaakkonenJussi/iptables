          stable and may change with every new version. It is therefore unsupported.

      Description: |
          The iptables package contains IPv6 (the next version of the IP
          protocol) support for iptables. Iptables controls the Linux kernel
          network packet filtering code, allowing you to set up firewalls and IP
          masquerading. 
          
          Install iptables-ipv6 if you need to set up firewalling for your
          network and you are using ipv6.
